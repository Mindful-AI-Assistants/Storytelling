<br><br>  

Welcome to the Storytelling repository! This repository is dedicated to the Storytelling discipline taken in the 1st semester of 2024 in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence undergraduate program at the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo (PUC-SP).

We extend our sincere gratitude to Professor [Rooney Ribeiro Albuquerque Coelho]() for his invaluable guidance and expertise throughout this course. His dedication to excellence in teaching has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of storytelling and data science.

## üìú About Storytelling

Storytelling is the art of telling stories, essential in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for effectively communicating findings and insights.

Through Storytelling, students learn to transform raw data into stories that inform, persuade, and inspire. This is crucial because while data analysis can reveal valuable insights, these insights are useless if they cannot be effectively communicated.

The Storytelling discipline in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence undergraduate program at PUC-SP aims to equip students with the necessary skills to tell effective stories with data. 

- **Key Storytelling** concepts include:
  
   - ***Narrative***: The structure and flow of the story you are telling with your data.
   - ***Data Visualization***: The graphical representation of data to highlight trends and patterns.
   - ***Context***: The background information that helps frame and interpret the data.
   - ***Simplicity***: The ability to convey complex information in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.
